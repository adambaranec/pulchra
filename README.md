# Pulchra
Hello everyone! 
Let's introduce Pulchra, a live coding environment for 3D graphics on the web. You may have heard of its predecessor, Fluxus - but let me tell you, Pulchra inspired from Fluxus' legacy with adding some new functionalities, mainly in 3D rendering.

The idea for this language came to me, when the production manager of A4, Bratislava's space for contemporary culture, realized that he did not know about any language which would be suited for 3D visuals.
This happened at a course of algorave music (music made with code), where we were also learning a live-coding environment primarily for 2D graphics - Punctual. It is able to create various shapes, colors, even react to sound - even though there was something missing. And I barely thought with what it was.

After a while, it came out! The idea was literally a live-coding language primarily focused on 3D graphics! Lying on the beach in Croatia, I started to write first lines of code for the environment. By the way, it would not be possible to work on this language without the amazing library Three-js. This library is a total game-changer, providing all the essential functionality for 3D graphics programming, including support for meshes, materials, lighting, and many more!

I am excited to announce Pulchra is working! This is seriously a huge moment - who knows, what all you brilliant coders out there create with it. So go ahead, play and drop a line about what you think. Peace!
