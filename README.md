#Why Pulchra?
Experience livecoding with 3D shapes in modern extent!

#The origins of Pulchra
It was one winter day in 2022. The production manager of [A4](https://a4.sk/), a space for contemporary culture in Bratislava, realized that he did not know about any language for generating 3D computer graphics.

At that time, we were attending a course called [Music in the digital space - how to live code](https://soundsweird.org/music-in-the-digital-space-how-to-live-code/). One of the languages we were learning was Punctual, live coding system for 2D visuals.

After a while, it came out! The idea was to design a language which would take all advantages of Fluxus, one of the first languages for 3D graphics. Lying on the beach in Croatia, I started to write first lines of code for the environment.
